##  Data Analytics

```{r pie, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
slices <- c(80, 10,5,5)
lbls <- c("Munging", "EDA", "Modeling", "Reporting")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="What is 'Data Analytics'")
```


## Data munging

- The process by which an analyist collects, organizes and maps data for downstream analysis.  
- Definitions vary, some include EDA in munging.
- Overall, I deliniate **munging** as the tasks that must be undertake in order to work with the relevant data.
- Important goal is to automate to the greatest extent possible (crucial for all phases of analytical work)
- Hence, `R` or other programitic approaches


## Data munging

```{r munging, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
slices <- c(20,20,20,20,20)
lbls <- c("import", "formatting", "integration", "summary", "visualization")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, main="What is 'Munging'")
```


## Munging challenges

- **import** challenges of importing data from disparate databases and legacy formats
- **formatting** converting data to appropriate formats, converting vectors to be recognized as dates, or categorical variables, or spatial coordinates, etc.
- **integration** often data will be stored/collected differently, ie. different spatio-temporal resolutions that require integration.
- **summary** what is missing? Is there a data dictionary? How was it collected?
- **visualiation** does the data make sense?  Often require visual inspections.  Big challenge as data sets explode in size!


## The `R` advantage

- `R` language is a powerful tool for data management.
- It has ~6,712 packages adding to base functionality.
- A large community contributing to the code base and extending capabilities.

## Interacting with `R`
- via the console

![r console](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/HTML/WindowsConsoleGray.png)


##

- via a graphical user interface (GUI)
![rstudio](http://www.linuxlinks.com/portal/content/reviews/Scientific/Screenshot-RStudio.png)


## Interactions with `R`

- `R` is built for both [*interactive programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_programming) and [*batch processing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing)
- Traditional analytics investigation occurs using and interactive approach

```{r}
X <- 4; Y <- 6
X + Y
```
- As opposed to batch operations in which to write the script save it as a `.R` file and then tell the CPU to execute the file. Outputs are observed after the entire analysis is executed.
```
> r xy.R
```


## Interactive computation

- a faster developmental model for analytical operations
- common paradigm in scientific programming
- Optional reading: [Semantics of interactive computation](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-332/paper4.pdf)

![cpuWorks](http://www.learningliftoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Prog.png)


## Scientific computing vs Batch computing
- core difference is the sequence of *input* & *output* cycles
- traditional (batch) development: 
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

DiagrammeR("
  graph LR;
    A[INPUT]-- Compute -->A2[OUTPUT];
")
```


## Scientific computing
- In scientific computing interativity is not as much about [*agile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) development as it is about iterative and thoughtful *analysis*.
- **Reading**: Wilson et al. 2014. “Best Practices for Scientific Computing.” PLoS Biology 12 (1): e1001745. [doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745).

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
DiagrammeR("
  graph LR;
    INPUT--> View 
    View --> OUTPUT
    OUTPUT --> Sort 
    Sort --> OUTPUT2;
")
```

## Who to thank for `R`
```{r}
citation()
```


## Working Directory
- A *working directory* is the [directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) in which your current `R` process is located within the operational [filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system).
- You can determine your current working directory
```{r}
getwd() # returns the current working directory 
```
- The `setwd()` function allows you to specify a location
```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop")
getwd()
```


## Workspace
- This should not be confused with your `R` *workspace* which is the set of data, functions, and activities that have been conducted during a programming session and which can be save in an `.Rdata` file.
- If you save an `.Rdata` file using `save.image()` function you can return to your working state, similar to walking away from your desk and coming back many hours later.
```
load("MyWorkspace.Rdata")  # loads a previous or save workspace
ls()                       # lists all objects in that workspace
```
- Rstudio provides this info in the *Workspace* tab



## Expressions
```{r}
# This is a comment, 
# all comments in R start with a # symbol

x <- 78       # This is a complete expression 
              # no printed results
y <-          # Incomplete expression
x             # auto-printing
print(x)      # explicit printing
```

## Expressions
- vector indices
```{r}
x <- 1:40     # Creats a vectors of values from 1 to 40
x 
```
- index printed in `[brackets]`

## `R` has five classes of objects

- numeric
- character
- logical
- integer
- complex

## 

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3); class(x)
x <- c("a", "b", "c"); class(x)
x <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE); class(x)
x <- 1:30; class(x)
x <- c(1+4i); class(x)
```


## Data structures
- `R` offers a number of structures to hold data including: vectors, matrices, array, lists, data frames, tables.
- Each structure is defined by dimensional and compositional characterisitics
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Dimension <- c("1D", "2D", "nD")
Homogeneous <- c("Atomic vector", "Matrix", "array")
Heterogeneous <- c("list", "data frame", "")
ds <- data.frame(Dimension, Homogeneous, Heterogeneous)
ds
```           
 
## Vectors
 
- we introduced vectors last class
- vectors are created using the construct `c()` function
```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)  # create a simple vector
str(x)

x <- vector("numeric", length=5)  #create an empty vector
x
```

## Indexing Vectors

```{r}
v <- rnorm(10, mean=290, sd=2); v
v[5]
# Do it again
v2 <- rnorm(10, mean=290, sd=2);v2
v2[5]
```


## Seeds

- making simulations reproducible with `set.seed()`
```{r}
set.seed(4)
v <- rnorm(10, mean=290, sd=2)
v[5]
# Do it again
set.seed(4)
v2 <- rnorm(10, mean=290, sd=2)
v2[5]
```

- all simulation or RNG work requires seeds to be reproducible.


## Matrices

- *matrices* are vectors with dimensionality.
```{r }
m <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
m

# Examine the matrix
attributes(m)
```


## How are matrices built?

- matricies in `R` are constructed *column-wise*

```{r }
m <- matrix(1:15, nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
m
```
- so when populating a matrix values are placed in cell (1,1) or the upper-left *first* and run down columns.

## Populating matrices
- a matrix can be populated from a *vector*
```{r}
m <- 1:15
dim(m) <- c(3,5)
```

- in `R` matrix references are usually (*R*, *C*) references.
```
c(4,5) #specifying a 4 row, 5 column matrix
m[2,4] # Identifying a position in matrix(m) at row 2, and col 4
```

## Matricies by binding
- matrices can also be constructed by binding data using the `rbind()` and the `cbind()` functions.

```{r}

a <- 1:5
b <- 6:10


m1 <- cbind(a,b)
m1

m2 <- rbind(a,b)
m2
```

## Lists in `R`

- *lists* are a powerful type of vector in `R`
- *list* elements may contain different classes
- *lists* can be constructed with `list()` or `c()`
```{r}
x <- list(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"), c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(3.14, 2.96, 7.90))
str(x)
```

## Lists in `R`
- lists can be *recursive* meaning they contain additional lists
- common data structure when working with more complex analyses
```{r]}
x <- list(list(list(list())))
str(x)
```

## Lists in `R`
- elements of lists can be referenced specifically
```{r}
x <- list(integers = 1:3,                         # code can be wrapped manually by
          alphabet = c("a", "b", "c"),            # ending with a comma
          logicals = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
          numbers = c(3.14, 2.96, 7.90))
x$logicals
```


## Data Frame
- most data is stored as data frames
- data frames are structues for storing data tables
- essentially a *data frame* is a list of vectors of equal length

## Data Frame
- common example is `mtcars` data set in `R`
```{r}
head(mtcars)  # head fxn shows the top 6 values
```

## Viewing data
- up to now we are inputing the data
- that data has been small easily viewable
- Sometimes we need to view a piece of the data
- the `head()` and `tail()` fxns 

## Viewing data
```{r}
tail(mtcars)
```
- `head()` & `tail()` can be used on vectors, matrices, data frames, or functions


## Data Import
- once we go behind a small # of values *data import* is essential
- to work with data from outside `R` the information must first be imported into the `R` environment
- all base function are associated with `read.table()`
- read more: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/read.table.html

## Read Table
```
read.table(file, header = FALSE, sep = "", quote = "\"'",
           dec = ".", numerals = c("allow.loss", "warn.loss", "no.loss"),
           row.names, col.names, as.is = !stringsAsFactors,
           na.strings = "NA", colClasses = NA, nrows = -1,
           skip = 0, check.names = TRUE, fill = !blank.lines.skip,
           strip.white = FALSE, blank.lines.skip = TRUE,
           comment.char = "#",
           allowEscapes = FALSE, flush = FALSE,
           stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors(),
           fileEncoding = "", encoding = "unknown", text, skipNul = FALSE)
```

## Read Table

- `file` is name of the file containing the data
```
read.table(file="mtcars.csv")
read.table(file="C://Users/Desktop//File name")
```

## `read.table()` Example
```{r}
# import the data to an object
dat <- read.table(file='/Users/kpurcell/Desktop/mtcars.csv') 
dim(dat)   # displays the dimensions of an object
# display a summary of object
summary(dat)
```

## `read.table()` Example
```{r}
dat <- read.table(file='/Users/kpurcell/Desktop/mtcars.csv',
                  header=TRUE,
                  sep=",")
dim(dat)   # displays the dimensions of an object

summary(dat)
```

## `read.table()` options
- lots of options to fit the input file you are working with
[read.table](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/read.table.html) help


## `read.csv()` function
- is a modified version of `read.table()`
- it has specific defaults set
```
read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", 
         quote = "\"", dec = ".", fill = TRUE, 
         comment.char = "", ...)
```

## `read.csv2()` function
- slightly different version
```
read.csv2(file, header = TRUE, sep = ";",
          quote = "\"", dec = ",", fill = TRUE,
          comment.char = "", ...)
```

## Delimited files
- .csv files are a common type of delimited file
- `read.delim()` 1 & 2 are aimed at other delimited files
- tab (`\t`) or space (`\s`) delimited specifically

## So far...

- the `read.XXX()` family of functions can be used on a number of standard text based input files that are common for data entry


## Additional packages for Data Import
```
library(xlsx)     # Read Excel spreadsheets.
library(RCurl)    # Scraping web
library(foreign)  # Importing from other software
library(openxlsx) # Importing from OSS
library(readxl)   # The definitive Excel reader.
library(readr)    # Wickham package for data import
```
- We will touch on more throughout the semester

## `readr()` Package
- The `readr()` package is an new package
- it builds upon `R` functionality

## Read 2 data frame
```{r}
library(readr)

# Read a csv file into a data frame
dat <- read_csv("/Users/kpurcell/Desktop/mtcars.csv")
head(dat)
```

## Read 2 vector
```{r}
# Read lines into a vector
dat <- read_lines("/Users/kpurcell/Desktop/mtcars.csv")
head(dat)
```

## Read 2 string
```{r}
# Read whole file into a single string
dat <- read_file("/Users/kpurcell/Desktop/mtcars.csv")
head(dat)
```


## mtcars

```{r}
str(mtcars)
```
