# Science & Research

---


## What is science?

- big question, lots of answers
- defined according to Bhattacherjee as:
1. contributes to body of science
2. follows scientific method
- assuming a familiarity w/scientific method if not [review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)

## Types of Science

- The word **Science** derives from the Latin *scientia* meaning knowledge
- Knowledge is diverse -> so is science
- Differences between natural sciences and social sciences?

## Natural vs. Social sciences

- natural sciences tend to be precise, accurate, deterministic
- social sciences tend to lack precision, are less deterministic and more ambiguous.
- **This has implications on analysis**

## Basic vs Applied

- Basic sciences (pure sciences) explain essential physical, chemical, and biological forces.
- Applied sciences study applications of the laws, theories, and results of the basic sciences.
- Overly, simplistic dichotomy!


## [Pasteur's quadrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur%27s_quadrant)

![quadrant](http://timkastelle.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pasteurs-quadrant.jpg)


## Operational Goal of Science

- discover laws
- postulate theories
- explain natural and social phenomena
- expand scientific knowledge

## 

> "Somtimes there may not be a single universal truth, but rather an equilibrium of  "multiple truths"". 

## The equilibrium of "multiple truths"

- This is an esoteric concept
- There is a continuum of knowledge in science.  
- Theories are being created and destroyed, improved and dispelled.
- Therefore the progress of science is defined by a progression of improvement marked by experimentation and logical reasoning.
- What does this mean in analytics/data science: all work is **cyclical**

## Inductive vs Deductive research

- **Inductive** - goal of inferring theory from observed data
- **Deductive** - goal of testing theory using experimental data
- Difference is *theory-building*(inductive) & *theory-testing*(deductive)
- In reality they are quite often mixed
- Often difference manifest in **methodology** (ie. theory building = Data mining; theory-testing = hypothesis testing)

## Experience is the teacher

- The cycle of research (Fig 1.1, pg 4) is essential to the progression of science
- Both *theory-building* and *theory-testing* are crucial to advancement
- Example: Karl Marx's theory of communism

## Scientific Method (SM)

- A standardized method or sequence of steps for building and acquiring scientific knowledge.

## Characteristics of SM

- Replicability - Experiment & Results should be able to be independently replicated
- Precision - theory must be defined sufficiently that others can apply those definitions for verification. 
- Falsifiability - theories must be defined so that they can be dis-proven
- Parsimony - simplest or logically most economical explanation

## Types of research

- Exploratory - define scope, magnitude, feasibility
- Descriptive - document phenomena of interest
- Explanatory - explain observed phenomena of interest
- Interesting corollary with analytics: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive


## History of Scientific Though

- Very high-level review
- 3^rd^ century BC, **rationalism** suggested that the natural world must be understood through logical reasoning.
- 16^th^ century, *Francis Bacon* suggested that the world in studied via empirical observation, hence **empiricism**
- 18^th^ century, *Critique of Pure Reason* (Immanual Kant) attempted to resolve the debate b/w **rationalism** and **empiricism**.
- 20^th^ century, *Karl Popper* suggested that the world is built on a tenuous set of conjectures that **can not** be proven only disproven. Philosophically this is referred to as **postpositivism**.


# Research Thinking

---

## Unit of Analysis

- **Unit of Analysis** refers to the target of the study
- Could be individuals, groups, business, regions, states, etc.
- Can be complex to define..
- Crime rate in a region.  Unit of analysis is the **region** not the crimes or criminals.
- Crimes would be a variable in the analysis of a region
- Early in a project take time to define and scope

## From Units to methods

- The unit of analysis defines the type of data that must be collected
- Related to **unit of replication** a more common term in statistics

## Construct

- a construct is an abstract idea that created to explain a phenoena
- **constructs** can be simple (unidimensional) or complex (multi-dimensional)
- simple/unidimensional construct = *weight*
- complex/multi-dimensional construct = *communication skill*
- 


## Operational definition

- a manner of defining constructs in terms of how they will be empirically measured.
- Example: income must be defined  as before or after-tax, annual or monthly, family of individuals

## Variables

- a measurable representation of an abstract construct
- Example: intelligence is measured in Intelligence quotient (IQ)

## Type of variables

- **independent variables** - variables that explain other variables
- **dependent variables** - those variables explained by independent variables
- **mediating variables** - variables explained by independent variables while also explaining dependent variables
- **moderating variables** - variables that influence the relationshop b/w independent and dependent variables
- **control variales** - unimportant but effect the dependent so much be controlled during exp.


# Best Practices in Scientific Computing

---

## Best Practices

- are a set of activities that are accepted by the professional community as "best in class"
- This paper details a set of practices that are proven effective based on their decades of shared experience

## Write programs for people

- Traditional thought is that programs are for computers
- a program should not require a reader to hold a lots of information in their head.
- Names should be consistent, distinct, and meaningful
- code style matters

## Let computers do the work

- automate repitive tasks
- Save recent commands in a file for re-use
- Automate workflows

## Incrimental change

- small steps, "fail quickly"
- Use version control system (Git, Subversion)
- Version control all manual steps (code not outputs)

## Limit repetition

- Data must have a single representitive
- modularize code (no cut and paste)
- Re-use code do not re-write code
- **My $0.02**: revise code

## Plan for mistakes

- add tests to programs to verify your code
- Use unit-testing (a bit off but good to know)
- Use bugs to test code - *more pretinent to production code*
- use a debugger

## Optimize after the code works

- use a code profiler
- write code at the highest level possible

## Document design and purpose, not mechanics

- document why you did something, not what you did
- keep code as simple as possible to not require explanation
- use comments in the code - *literate programming*

## Collaborate

- use established code (packages)
- paired programming - mainly for practice not class!
- use issue tracking (implemented in github etc.)
